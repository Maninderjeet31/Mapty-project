MAPTY - Track your Workout
 
 Overview
 
Mapty is an interactive workout logging application with minimilistic design approach. 
The user is given the ability to create a log of their daily workouts. 
Depending on the type of the workout, wheteher you went for a run or went on a track for cycling, the user can log based on that. 
These choices are made posible because of the APIs used in real time during the project, javaScript features like Asynchronus JavaScript and AJAX.
 
 Usage
 1. Initially, the user gets a map based on their location which is made possible by using LEAFLET, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
 2. The user can start loggin their workout by clicking anywhere on the map where they went did running or cycling. Which then displays an input block to get all the relative information.
 
 3. Based upon type of the workout selected, the input block asks for the inputs which are relative to the workout type.
 
 4. The user can log more than one workout and they all get displayed on the side of the window for fast access.
 
 5. When the user enters any value which is not appropriate for that input type, the user gets an alert message telling them what went wrong.
 
 6. The application even notifies in the beginning if the maps were not able to load because of location restriction to the website.
 
 7. For future reference, if user closes the current session and opens it up any other time, all the previously logged workouts will still be there as they are stored in local storage of their machine.
